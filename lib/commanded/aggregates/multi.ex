defmodule Commanded.Aggregate.Multi do
  @moduledoc """
  Use `Commanded.Aggregate.Multi` to generate multiple events from a single
  command.

  This can be useful when you want to emit multiple events that depend upon the
  aggregate state being updated.

  ## Example

  In the example below, money is withdrawn from the bank account and the
  updated balance is used to check whether the account is overdrawn.

      defmodule BankAccount do
        defstruct [
          account_number: nil,
          balance: 0,
          state: nil,
        ]

        alias Commanded.Aggregate.Multi

        def withdraw(
          %BankAccount{state: :active} = account,
          %WithdrawMoney{amount: amount})
          when is_number(amount) and amount > 0
        do
          account
          |> Multi.new()
          |> Multi.execute(&withdraw_money(&1, amount))
          |> Multi.execute(&check_balance/1)
        end

        defp withdraw_money(%BankAccount{account_number: account_number, balance: balance}, amount) do
          %MoneyWithdrawn{
            account_number: account_number,
            amount: amount,
            balance: balance - amount
          }
        end

        defp check_balance(%BankAccount{account_number: account_number, balance: balance})
          when balance < 0
        do
          %AccountOverdrawn{account_number: account_number, balance: balance}
        end
        defp check_balance(%BankAccount{}), do: []
