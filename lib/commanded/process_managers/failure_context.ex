  Contains the data related to a failure.

  The available fields are:

  - `pending_commands` - the pending commands that were not executed yet
  - `process_manager_state` - the state the process manager would be in
    if the command would not fail.
  - `last_event` - the last event the process manager received
  - `context` - the context of failures (to be passed between each failure),
    used in example to count retries.
